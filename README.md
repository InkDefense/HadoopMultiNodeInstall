# HadoopMultiNodeInstall
One of the numerous configurations for Hadoop to run multiple nodes

The unix file included simply writes out the configuration to core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml, and yarn-site.xml so that I don't have to manually type it in each time I want to run a cluster.
